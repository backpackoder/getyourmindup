      paragraphs: [
        `Stress is the body's natural response to challenging situations. When faced with stressors,
        such as work deadlines, family responsibilities, or financial pressures, the body releases
        stress hormones that prepare us to cope with the situation. However, chronic stress can lead to
        anxiety, depression, and various other mental health issues. Recognizing the signs of stress and
        its impact on our mental health is the first step toward effective stress management.`,
